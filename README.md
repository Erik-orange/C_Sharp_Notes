# C_Sharp_Notes
___

* C# source code compiles to intermediate code. The CLR uses a JIT compiler to translate the intermediate code to code for the processor used. 

* A `declaration` defines a part of a program. `Statements` control the sequence of execution of the program. `Expressions` compute values and have other effects.

* Integer division truncates the result.

* You can get the remainder by using the `modulo` operator, the `%` character:



## Data Types

* Numbers
  * int
  * double
  * float
  * fixed point (decimal)
  
  
* The `decimal` type has a smaller range but greater precision than `double`.
