# C_Sharp_Notes
___

* Stable Release (Sept 2019): v. 7.3

* The key organizational concepts in C# are programs, `namespaces`, `types`, `members`, and `assemblies`. 

  C# programs consist of one or more source files. 
  
  Programs declare types, which contain members and can be organized into namespaces. 
  
  Classes and interfaces are examples of types. 
  
  Fields, methods, properties, and events are examples of members. 
  
  When C# programs are compiled, they are physically packaged into assemblies. Assemblies typically have the file extension .exe or .dll, depending on whether they implement applications or libraries, respectively.
  
  * C# source code compiles to intermediate code. The CLR uses a JIT compiler to translate the intermediate code to code for the specific processor used. 

* C# offers garbage collection, exception handling, and is a type-safe language.

* A `declaration` defines a part of a program. `Statements` control the sequence of execution of the program. `Expressions` compute values and have other effects.

Accronynms:
* IL - Intermediate Language

* JIT - Just In Time

* CLR - Common Language Runtime

## Data Types

* class
* interfaces
* enum
* delegates

Built-In Types:

* `bool`
* `byte`
* `char`
* `double`
* `decimal`
* `int`
* `float`
* `long`
* `object`
* `short`
* `string`

* Numbers
  * int
  * double
  * float
  * decimal (fixed point)
  
  
* The `decimal` type has a smaller range but greater precision than `double`.

* Integer division truncates the result.

* You can get the remainder by using the `modulo` operator, the `%` character.
